# Long Distance Relationship Advisor 

### It tells you if it's a good idea or not to commit yourself in a Long Distance Relationship (LDR), using a Poisson Distribution given the number of people you meet each year like your partner and how many years are you going to be in LDR, and your estimated probability to survive. It plots a graphic of the poisson distribution as well.
